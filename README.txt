Schedule events, send invitations, track RSVPs, and collect PayPal payments.

== Description ==

RSVPMaker is an event scheduling and RSVP tracking plugin for WordPress. Use it to:

* Schedule and promote events of all sorts: conferences, classes, seminars, speaking events, parties and weddings are a few common uses.
* Register attendees, prompting them to enter whatever information you need, including the names of guests.
* Collect money using PayPal or Stripe.
* Promote your event on social media and send out email list invitations using the integration with MailChimp. Can also be used to for email newsletters based on blog posts or event roundups from your website.
* Create webinars and other online events leveraging free resources like the YouTube Live service.
* Use the Limited Time Content Gutenberg block -- a wrapper block that can include paragraphs, images, and other content -- to set a start and/or end time for the display of content. Useful for promoting events and limited time pricing on your home page or in the body of a blog post, without looking foolish if you forget to take down those promotions.

RSVPMaker is free and open source, with no upsell to a premium version. We occasionally create custom features on contract, but where possible those enhancements are folded back into the core plugin code. RSVPMaker also aims to be developer-friendly, allowing you to build event-centric applications on top of it.

Creating and Managing Events

RSVPMaker events are created and edited just like blog posts in the WordPress editor, with the addition of parameters like event date (so the items can be listed chronologically and displayed on a calendar grid). Supports the Gutenberg editor as well as the classic WordPress editor.

You can use RSVPMaker for event announcements, or turn on the Collect RSVPs function and set additional options for sending email notifications, customizing confirmation and reminder messages, and setting a price or prices if you will be requesting online payments via PayPal.

RSVP reports can be viewed on the administrator's dashboard or downloaded as spreadsheets.

If you hold events on a recurring schedule, such as First Monday or Every Friday, you can define a template with the boilerplate details and quickly generate multiple entries that follow that schedule. Individual event posts can still be customized. For example, you might book a series of monthly events for the year and add the names of speakers or agenda details as you go along.

In addition to being useful for event invitations, the MailChimp integration can be used to generate newsletters incorporating roundups of upcoming events and recent blog posts.

Use the RSVPMaker widget if you would like to add an events listing to your WordPress sidebar.
1. OPTIONAL: Depending on your theme, you may want to create a single-rsvpmaker.php template to prevent confusion between the post date and the event date (move the post date display code to the bottom or just remove it). A sample for the Twentyten theme is included with this distribution.
1. OPTIONAL: To enable online payments for events, obtain a PayPal API signature and password.
1. OPTIONAL: Install [RSVPMaker Excel](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rsvpmaker-excel) if you want the ability to export RSVP reports to a spreadsheet.

You can also include a style attribute for CSS wrapper code such as a border, padding, and background color for the block. If no post_id is specified, the output will be all the content from the start tag to the end tag. With a post_id, no end tag is required. Include the attributes start and/or end to specify a start or end time for the display of a post, for example start="2017-11-01 07:00" end="2017-12-31 23:00" or start="November 1, 2017" end="December 31, 2017 11 pm"
* The style attribute now also works with the rsvpmaker_one shortcode. Fixed it so you can specify something like [rsvpmaker_one post_id="next" one_format="compact"] and the one_format attribute will be respected. (In the last release, specifying "next" instead of a number would always output the full post).

= 4.9.4 =

* Fixes to RSVP Mailer functions for setting up email design templates, pulling content from the blog or calendar.

= 4.9.3 =

* Better organization of the RSVPMaker settings screen, divided into tabs

= 4.9.2 =

* Option to have RSVPMaker calculate event fees, even if you haven't set up an online payment service. This "Cash or Custom" option also allows you to add a custom payment gateway.
* Added hook for custom payment methods, 'rsvpmaker_cash_or_custom' action [documentation](https://rsvpmaker.com/blog/2017/10/18/custom-payment-gateway/)

= 4.9.1 =

* Changed the way the "additional editors" function works, if activated in settings. This allows users with authoring but not editing rights to share the right to edit an RSVPMaker event or all the events based on a particular template. To make this work more reliably, the author ID # on the post is now changed when another authorized user (designated by the original author) updates the post.
* Events embedded in a post or page using the rsvpmaker_one shortcode can now be set to automatically stop displaying when the event date is past.
* Added new RSVP Mailer options for sending to all past event attendees or all who registered within a specified timeframe.

= 4.9 =

* Test for PHP version before loading code that requires namespace support (introduced in PHP 5.3). Required for ReCaptcha library.

= 4.8.9 =

* Added embed_dateblock shortcode
* Bug fix, properly removing calendar sql filter
* Bug fix, css for admin screens

= 4.8.8 =

* Event templates can now be set to let RSVPMaker automatically add dates to the end of the specified schedule
* Fixed a bug with the recording of timeslot signups (often used to enroll volunteers for specific shifts)

= 4.8.7 =

* Adding support for Google ReCaptcha by incorporating Google's PHP library

= 4.8 =

* Never show "0 signed up so far" (start at 1)
* Checkbox for pages to supress the display of page menu on the front end. Intended as a simple way of turning a full width page template into a landing page, reducing temptation for visitors to click away rather than completing a call to action such as registering for an event embedded in the page.

= 4.7.9 =

* Changed defaults, such as number of days listed on calendar page, to match most common usage.
* Added a button for inserting a single event on a page, covering variations to show full event with button or form, form only, or button only. Useful for building landing pages promoting one or more events.

= 4.7.8 =

* Fix for email lookup on multisite

= 4.7.7 =

* Fixed lookup of contact info based on email. Also checks for prior rsvps for the current event.

= 4.7.6 =

* Fixing bug in the tracking of "private data on file"

= 4.7.5 =

* Try to minimize duplicate RSVPs by searching RSVP list by email address, as the user is typing their email address into the form. On match, they are prompted to update their existing registration rather than adding a new one.
* Option to turn off email confirmations

= 4.7.4 =

* Factoring out anonymous function call (fails on older versions of PHP)

= 4.7.3 =

* Fix for bug overwriting $_GET["page"] on admin screens

= 4.7.2 =

* Improvements to clone event / create template from event functions
* Fix to prevent other plugins from modifying the mce editor on reminders editor page

= 4.7.1 =

* Fix to rsvpmaker_upcoming display so doesn't show "No events listed" when future events out of date range
* Meeting durations of 10-55 minutes now supported in dropdown; 15 minute increments after 1 hour

= 4.7 =

* Fix conflict with Jetpack

= 4.6.9 =

* Cleanup of utility functions.

= 4.6.8 =

* RSVP form fields can now be set to appear only on the guest form, not on the main RSVP form. Previously, all fields appeared on the main form and only displaying them on the guest form was optional.

= 4.6.7 =

Tweaks for compatibility with PHP 7

= 4.6.4 =

* Notification Templates screen, which appears under RSVP Mailer on the admin dashboard, lets you customize notification and confirmation messages and the information to be included in them. For example, if you want to use the word Registration rather than RSVP in your subject line, or remove the Update RSVP button from confirmation messages, you can now do so.
* Tagged a few front-end translation strings that had been missed previously.

= 4.6.3 =

* RSVP Report now lets you see details for multiple upcoming or recent events

= 4.6 =

* Tweak to More Events link

= 4.5.9 =

* Improved navigation for archive pages.

= 4.5.6 =

* Fix for volunteer slots signups.

= 4.5.5 =

* New action 'rsvp_recorded' passes and array that you can log or process with your own add_action hook
* Bug fix for changing time format

= 4.5.2 =

* Support for creating a webinar landing page for something other than YouTube Live.
* Added filter for data copied from template to individual posts during updates.

= 4.5.1 =

* Fix for copying metadata from template, plus another random bug

= 4.4.9 =

* Fix for UTF-8 encoding of non-English characters in strftime output

= 4.4.8 =

* Fix for event_listing shortcode
* Tweaks to get_future_events and get_past_events functions

= 4.4.7 =

* Change coding for date display to work in other locales (PHP strftime instead of date)

= 4.4.6 =

* Integration with WP Simple Pay Lite for Stripe (should also work with Pro version), making Stripe payment service an alternative to PayPal. Requires that your site (or at least the event page) be secured via SSL
* Fix to numbering for guest blanks

= 4.4.4 =

Tweaks to the system for scheduled reminder / follow up messages. Plus some overdue code cleanup.

= 4.4.1 =

Added option to show timezone conversion. Uses JavaScript to convert from UTC time to local time, according to the settings on the user's computer. Useful for online events such as webinars with a worldwide audience.

= 4.3.9 =

* Updated system for managing YouTube Live webinars through RSVPMaker, now automatically generates model landing page plus confirmation, reminder, and follow up messages that you can use as a starting point. When you view an event or a landing page in the editor, navigation links make it easier to navigate between the two, or to the related confirmation and reminder messages.
* Confirmation and reminder messages are now displayed in the RSVPMailer email template. If you have several templates, you can designate which one should be used for these transactional messages.
* Registration can be required to view the landing page containing the YouTube Live player. If people register to watch a replay, they will get whatever series of follow up messages you created for the original event. So if a follow up message was supposed to go out two hours after the live event, replay viewers will get that message two hours after watching the replay.
* \[ylchat\] shortcode now automatically stops outputting the iframe for the YouTube Live chat associated with the video feed when it is no longer available after the program. This prevents people from seeing what looks like an error if they view the replay. Now instead of supporting an attribute asking for the time when the feed should be deactivated, the only supported attribute is a note field for a message to be displayed over the chat box. Example: \[ylchat note="Enter your questions below"\]

= 4.3.8 =

* Styling tweaks to avoid conflicts with Twentyseventeen (and probably other themes)
* New shortcode: \[rsvpmaker_one post_id="10"\] displays a single event post with ID 10. Shows the complete form unless the attribute showbutton="1" is set
* New shortcode: \[rsvpmaker_form post_id="10"\] displays just the form associated with an event (ID 10 in this example. Could be useful for embedding the form in a landing page that describes the event but where you do not want to include the full event content.

= 4.3.7 =

YouTube Live webinar setup help on reminders page

= 4.3.5 =

Tweak to PayPal code

= 4.3.4 =

Tweak to localization/translation code.

= 4.3.3 =

Notification to make sure timezone is set properly.

= 4.3.2 =

* Improved event post previews on Facebook by adding event date to the end of the title. RSPMaker now outputs its own og:title Facebook Open Graph metadata (on by default, but can be turned off in settings if this interferes with other SEO plugins).
* New shortcode, \[rsvpmaker_next\], displays just the next scheduled event. If the type attribute is set, that becomes the next event of that type. Example: \[rsvpmaker_next type="webinar"\]. Also, this displays the complete form rather than the RSVP Now! button unless showbutton="1" is set.
* When embedding a YouTube Live stream in a page or post of your WordPress site, you can use the shortcode \[ylchat\] to embed the associated comment stream (which can be used to take questions from the audience). This extracts the video ID from the YouTube link included in the page and constructs the iframe for the chat window, according to Google's specifications. You can add attributes for width and height to override the default values (100% wide x 200 pixels tall). To make the comments box stop displaying after the end time for the webinar, use the attribute until as in \[ylchat until="January 30, 2017 8 pm"\] or \[ylchat until="2017-01-30 20:00:00"\]

= 4.3 =

Made sure all metadata, including pricing, is copied from event templates to individual events.

= 4.2.8 =

Fixes to captcha, date encoding in post slug

= 4.2.7 =

* Option for RSVP attendees to cancel when RSVPs are closed (max attendees threshhold met)
* Number of guests added limited according to max attendees setting

= 4.2.5 =

* Tracking of email unsubscribes for local email broadcasts (to members and event attendees). Will also unsubscribe email address from the default MailChimp list, if set.

= 4.2.4 =

* Option to have calendar grid display week starting on Monday rather than Sunday (add attribute weekstart="Monday" to rsvpmaker_upcoming or rsvpmaker_calendar shortcodes)
* Tweaks to mailer. For email to website members or event attendees, default is now to use from email of logged in user rather than email address specified for use with MailChimp.

= 4.2.3 =

* Improvements to RSVP form builder. Better round trip handling of additional fields added.
* Bug fix to code the encodes date into permalink.

= 4.2 =

* RSVPMaker Events widget can now be set to only show events of a specific type (event types are a taxonomy similar to post categories). Example: only show events of the type Featured, rather than all upcoming events.
* New RSVPMaker Events By Type widget shows a listing of the types you have established, with a count of the upcoming events for each.

= 4.1.8 =

Update for better compatibility with SMTP plugins and the SendGrid plugin.

= 4.1.7 =

Adding JQuery datepicker calendar widget (longtime wishlist item, finally got it working)

= 4.1.6 =

* Added rich text editor for Editor's Note on scheduled email broadcasts.
* Fixes to content import for email broadcasts and iCal appointment reminder.

= 4.1.5 =

* Code updated for translation
* Mailer now provides an equivalent of the WordPress YouTube embed (displays the YouTube preview image for a video with a link to the YouTube address for that content)
* Bug fixes to mailer function

= 4.1.4 =

* Additional options for scheduled email.
* Set a condition that has to be met for the message to be sent (example: roundup of events shouldn't be sent if there are currently no future events listed).
* Making it easier to see which posts have scheduled broadcasts and for what time.

= 4.1.3 =

* More options for adding an Editors Note to a scheduled email newsletter (can be based on an excerpt from a sselected blog post).
* Option to send a preview version of a scheduled email 1 to 24 hours prior to the scheduled broadcast time.

= 4.0 =

* Addition of mailer for invitations and other messages, with support for MailChimp lists.
* Mailer includes the ability to schedule emails or establish newsletters that will be sent on a recurring schedule, such as a roundup of events from the calendar to be sent weekly.

= 3.9.9 =

Fix for duplicate dates appearing on posts after upgrading.

= 3.9.8 =

* Fixed the archive feed for the rsvpmaker post type to sort by date order. So a url like rsvpmaker.com/rsvpmaker/ now works for showing an event listing. You can also get an RSS feed of your events at rsvpmaker.com/rsvpmaker/feed/
* Event Types set in the editor are now displayed like categories on a blog post, and clicking on them will take you to a feed for that event type. Example: http://rsvpmaker.com/blog/rsvpmaker-type/featured/
* Added shortcode for displaying the RSVP Report publicly on the website. Tag: rsvp_report_shortcode, accepts one attribute, public="1" or public="0" with the default being public="0" (login required)
* Settings page for RSVPMaker now allows you to specify one of the page templates included with your theme that should be used for single event posts. If you have a custom theme, you can create a single-rsvpmaker.php template specifically for events. But if you're working with a free or purchased theme, you may find that it includes a full-width page template or other variation that works better than the one that would be used by default.

= 3.9.7 =

Better functionality for membership websites, where the people entering RSVPs have user accounts and log in prior to responding.
* The system will now automatically look up any previous RSVPs associated with the same account (which for unauthenticated users only happens if they click the update link in a confirmation email).
* Form fields will be filled in based on user metadata, provided that the form field names match the usermeta fields. Example: a membership site records the user's mobile number as mobile_phone, so the form field for Mobile Phone will be filled in automatically on the RSVP form - [See blog post](http://rsvpmaker.com/blog/2016/06/20/using-rsvpmaker-on-membership-websites/)

= 3.9.6 =

Bug fix - delete guests

= 3.9.4 =

* Restoring iCal attachments on RSVP confirmation emails. This was included in a previous release but removed because of a problem with Microsoft Outlook compatibility - now fixed.
* Updated coding for translation - all display strings should now be coded to allow for translation.

= 3.9 =

Significant change to the event data model. By storing dates as post metadata, this release eliminates the dependency on the custom database table previously used for event dates. One advantage: content will be easier to move between websites using standard WordPress import/export routines.

= 3.8.1 =

Bug fix: timezone display

= 3.8 =

Conditional display of form options depending on pricing (whether the user is paying for the lunch as well as the workshop)

= 3.7.5 =

Time limits on prices for online payments. Example: "early bird" pricing for conference registration, where after the deadline pricing goes up.

= 3.7.4 =

* Attendees who update an RSVP for which they previously recorded a payment are now prompted to pay any difference (for additional guests or a change in pricing options)
* The RSVP Report screen now lets an administrator update attendee records or record a payment (for example, if a payment was received offline rather than through PayPal). Payments recorded by an administrator are logged on the 'PayPal log' with the username of the user who recorded them.

= 3.7 =

* Overhaul of PayPal payment functionality, including easier setup
* Better handling of guest registration, including the ability to prompt guests for data such as meal choices

= 3.6.4 =

* German translation, courtesy of Björn Wilkens
* Update of PO Edit POT catalog for translations
* Warning message to make it easier to see when updating events based on a new event template might overwrite customizations

= 3.6.3 =

Added checkbox option for whether to include the content of an event listing in the RSVP confirmation and reminder messages.

= 3.6.2 =

Adds the rsvpmaker_timed shortcode, which can be wrapped around any bit of content in a page or a post that should only be displayed after a given time, until a given time, or between a start and end time. The shortcode attributes are start, end, too_early, and too_late. Put a plain language date like 'January 1, 2016 7 pm' in the start and/or end fields, or use a database style date like '2016-01-20 19:00' and RSVPMaker will test the current time against those rules. If the viewer is coming too the site too early or too late, according to those rules, the shortcode will return either an empty string or the contents of the too_early / too_late parameters, if set. Otherwise, the content will be returned as it normally would be.

Example:

[rsvpmaker_timed start="January 1, 2016" end="January 30, 2016 11:59 pm" too_early="sorry, too early" too_late="sorry, too late" ]

= 3.6 =

* CSS changes aimed at more consistent formatting of the form across themes.
* RSVP Reminders function will now let you create and edit follow up email messages to attendees for events from the past week.

= 3.5.9 =

Create a template based on an existing event, or clone an event (copy content to a new title for a new date).

= 3.5.8 =

Got drop-down lists for future events, event types working in calendar popup

= 3.5.7 =

* Placeholder image and popup user interface for the calendar now provided for the WordPress rich text editor. This allows a site editor to insert or update an events listing with optional calendar display, without the need to work directly with the rsvpmaker_upcoming shortcode and its parameters.
* Popup editor also provided for setup of the RSVPMaker form. You can still edit or enhance the HTML/shortcodes directly, but this should make it easier to get the coding right (particularly when you don't want to do anything more elaborate than add an additional field.

= 3.5.6 =

* You can now download to CSV for basic spreadsheets without the need to install the additional RSVPMaker Excel plugin.
* Removing iCal attachments from confirmation and reminder messages for now. Ran into some problems with Microsoft Outlook that will take time to debug.

= 3.5.4 =

Confirmation and reminder messages now include an iCal attachment, making it easier for recipients to add the event to their own appointment calendars.

= 3.5 =

* [Support for Google Hangouts on Air](http://rsvpmaker.com/hangouts), the free video broadcast service, makes it possible to organize webinars on a budget using RSVPMaker.
* Overhaul of the system for creating and sending email confirmation messages and scheduled reminders.

= 3.4.4 =

Fixing bug in RSVP Report.

= 3.3.8, 3.3.9 =

Revisiting fix to widget code. Not as fixed as I thought.

= 3.3.7 =

Updated widget code to use the newer style of PHP object constructor, replacing code deprecated under WordPress 4.3.

= 3.3.1 =

Bug fix: display of multiday events in calendar view

= 3.3 =

* Event templates modified to support multiple choices on frequency and day of the week. For example, "Every week on Monday and Wednesday" or "First and Third Monday"
* Add to Google Calendar / Download to Outlook (iCal) icons now shown by default (can be disabled on settings screen)
* Added rsvpmaker_calendar shortcode for displaying the calendar independently of the rsvpmaker_upcoming event listing.

= 3.2.8 =

* Updated for WordPress 4.2.2.
* Translation files updated.
* Duration and category set in event templates now copied to events based on that template.
* Fix to date display when duration is set (timezone adjustment)

= 3.2.6 =

Fixed next post / previous post links to reflect chronological order of events, rather than post_date

= 3.2.5 =

Added option to include timestamp when RSVP was recorded in RSVP Report or download to Excel.

= 3.2.4 =

* Bug fix - projected dates for event templates
* Email attendees option added to RSVP Report (a mailto: link with the addresses of all attendees)

= 3.2.3 =

Fixes a CSS bug with the display of multiple prices

= 3.2.2 =

* Fix for bug with setting to display or hide the count of people who have RSVP'ed for an event.

= 3.0.8 =

* Tweak to PayPal success/error messages, logging of messages
* Fixing bug related to rsvpmaker_upcoming shortcode display (unset variable)

= 3.0.7 =

Fix to calendar display

= 3.0.6 =

Bug fix: correct handing of "More Events" link. The "events page" field on the RSVPMaker settings screen should be set to a full url like http://rsvpmaker.com/events/

= 3.0.5 = 

Additional rsvpmaker_upcoming attribute of one="next" or one="slug-here" or one="123" (post id) to [highlight a single event in a page or blog post](http://rsvpmaker.com/2014/01/embedding-a-single-event-in-a-page-or-post/).

= 3.0.4 =

Fix to handle password protected posts properly (previously was showing RSVP form even if content was supposed to be protected).

= 3.0.3 =

= 3.0.2 =

* Tweaked code to avoid overwriting event post slugs that have been set manually.

Bug fixes, primarily in the event template functions.

= 2.8.8 =

Bug fixes. Checkbox settings on editing screen weren't being recorded properly.

= 2.8.7 =

Bug fix for incorrect rounding of ticket prices.

= 2.8.6 =

More complete Spanish translation

= 2.8.5 =

* Spanish language translation
* Option to allow event authors to designate other users who can edit an event or, more importantly, an event template -- and all events derived from that template. This allows users who do not have full editing rights to be granted rights to edit specific events or series of events. Useful on community websites where several representatives of a group or club may wish to share editing rights, without the site owner having to make them editors of the entire site or of all events.

= 2.8.4 =

Additional form customization shortcodes for checkbox and radio buttons. See [form customization](http://rsvpmaker.com/2012/07/rsvpmaker2-5/)

= 2.8.3 =

Bug fix - trying to address issue some users report with permalinks. Switched to get_post_permalink() instead of get_permalink() (according to Codex, may be better at handling custom post types)

= 2.8.1 and 2.8.2 =

Improvements to template function.

= 2.8 =

* Event template function - more flexible way of handling recurring events
* Update of translation files, more admin functions included

= 2.7.8 =

* Bug fix: recurring events utility was broken, now it's not
* Bug fix: calendar navigation from month to month fixed for sites without pretty permalinks (?page_id=123 format)

= 2.7.7 =

Removed a spam check that created more problems than it solved.

= 2.7.6 =

* Fixes to paypal code
* Better handling of query string post addresses (question mark format rather than pretty permalinks)
* Sort by chronological option for RSVPMaker posts in admin screen
* RSVP Report option to show members who have not responded (for membership sites where users log in to a WordPress account before responding, tracks user IDs). Must be activated on settings screen.

= 2.7.5 =

* Fixed a glitch with display of CAPTCHA image
* Added option to hide yes/no radio boxes (assume the answer is yes)

= 2.7.4.1 and 2.7.4.2 =

Bug fixes

= 2.7.4 =

You can now specify an SMTP account to be used for more reliable delivery of notification emails (less likely to be flagged as spam if they're coming from a real account).

= 2.7.3 =

Another bug fix related to JavaScript output.

= 2.7.2 =

Bug fix. RSVPMaker-specific JavaScript was being output on other post types. Oops.

= 2.7.1 =

* Improved functionality for attendees updating their RSVPs. Previous data loaded from email address coded in link (from confirmation message) or from profile of a logged in user.
* Fixed JavaScript error that was interfering with display attendees function.
* Fixed error in More Events link for an event listing.

= 2.7 =

* Added the option to require a login prior to RSVP for membership-oriented sites where event attendees have a user name and password in WordPress. Name and email can automatically be filled in on the form. It's possible to read in other profile data by customizing the rsvpmaker_profile_lookup function (see the documentation on RSVPMaker customization at rsvpmaker.com).

= 2.6 =

Incremental update to translation files.

= 2.5.9 =

* Norwegian translation (thank you: Thomas Nybø) and update of translation source file.

* Added checkbox to let you specify whether the count of people who have RSVPed should always be shown (or only when a maximum number of participants is specified).

= 2.5.8 =

Bugfix

= 2.5.7 =

* Form customization now includes the ability to set fields as required, with both client and server-side validation. This works with the new shortcode-style method of specifying form fields and form layout. Example: `[rsvpfield textfield="phone" required="1"]`. By default, the required fields are first, last, and email.

* The filter used to add RSVP form fields has also been updated with a lower priority index to make it execute before other filters on the_content. This is in response to a user complaint about interaction with a related posts plugin that also operates on the_content, where the related posts widget was appearing above rather than below the form. New call is `add_filter('the_content','event_content',5)`

= 2.5.6 =

Fixes bug fix with some checkbox options not being set / cleared correctly in the event editor.

= 2.5.5 =

* The date editing section of the event editor now uses drop-downs controls for both adding dates and editing dates.

* rsvpmaker_upcoming shortcode now accepts limit="x" (show x number of events) as an attribute. Example `[rsvpmaker_upcoming limit="3"]` would retrieve a maximum of 3 posts. You can also use add_to_query="myquerystring" to modify the query using query_posts() syntax. Example: `[rsvpmaker_upcoming add_to_query="p=99"]` would retrieve a single rsvpmaker post with the ID of 99. 

* Code changes to prevent a potential security risk with user submitted data in RSVP Reports, use of esc_attr() on variables to prevent script injection.

= 2.5.4 =

* Moved functions for downloading RSVP results to Excel to a separate plugin, RSVPMaker Excel.

* Several bugfixes were released following version 2.5, and a few more are included in this release.

= 2.5 =

Introduced a new method for customizing the RSVP form, either on the settings screen or on a per-event basis. NOTE THAT PREVIOUS CUSTOMIZATIONS WILL NOT BE AUTOMATICALLY BE PRESERVED. The new method provides greater design freedom, allowing you to change the form layout, the order in which fields appear, and whether you want to include the guest section or a note field. A series of shortcodes are provide to generate the fields in the correct format for RSVPMaker.

This release also includes some code cleanup and a fix to the JavaScript function for adding guest fields (thanks to soaringthor for the code shared on the support forum).

= 2.4.2 =

Fix to PayPal code for handling currency other than USD.

= 2.4.1 =

Fix to calendar grid display, navigation between months.

= 2.4 =

Number format options on settings screen for non-U.S. currencies. For example, PLN 1.000,00 (Polish currency, European separation for thousands and decimal) instead of $1,000.00

= 2.3.9 =

* Updates to Polish translation by Jaroslaw Zelinski
* Fix for multi-currency support (display of currency code rather than $ for currencies other than USD)

= 2.3.6 =

* Introducing Polish translation by Jaroslaw Zelinski
* Corrections to translation file setup

= 2.3.5 =

* Improvements to automated reminders. Ability to set timing for reminders cron job

= 2.3.4 =

* Automated event reminders to people on RSVP list for an event (experimental)
* Email and confirmation messages set to UTF-8

= 2.3.3 =

Bug fix - rsvp report

= 2.3.2 =

* Fixing character encoding issue with database table for RSVP responses (setting to utf-8 for better multi-language compatibility).
* Fixed typographical error on calendar display (comma between month and year)

= 2.3.1 =

More changes for use with ChimpBlast

= 2.3 =

* Currency for use with PayPal payments can now be customized on Settings screen
* Minor changes for use with ChimpBlast

= 2.2 =

Added option to require people to decode the secret message in a CAPTCHA image when completing the RSVP form. Useful if you're getting spam bot submissions.

= 2.1 =

* Fields for RSVP form can now be edited from the settings panel. Previously modifying the form required some PHP hacking.
* You can now get a listing of past events with some attributes for the event_listings shortcode. Suggesting past="1" format="headline" date_format="F jS, Y"

= 2.0 =

Fixed code for downloading reports to Excel (again), this time based on the [PHPExcel](http://www.phpexcel.net/) library

Fixing translation files that were missing from svn

= 1.7 =

Bug fixes: display glitch, form spam filtering

= 1.6 =

= 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 =

= 1.2 =

= 1.1 =

* Bug fix for uninstall.php file.
* Fixed display of events with no RSVP set.

= 1.0 =

* Added a `basic_form` function that you can override to change the basic fields of the RSVP form. For example, you can change it to omit the section that asks for the names of guests. This is in addition to the `rsvp_profile` function, which is used to collect additional contact details such as phone # or mailing address. See the instructions for [__adding custom functions__](http://www.rsvpmaker.com/2010/12/changing-the-rsvp-form-other-customizations/).
* You have the option of allowing the names of attendees and the contents of the notes field to be displayed publicly. To avoid encouraging spam entries, this content is loaded via AJAX and only when the user clicks the Show Attendees button
* Moved most of the default formatting into a CSS file that is queued up on pages that show event content. There is in option on the settings page for specifying your own css file to use instead.  Most inline styles have been replaced by class selectors. However, the styling of the RSVP Now button is still set on the RSVPMaker settings screen. Works better for email distribution of events.
* RSVP Report now lists timestamp on reply and lets you sort by either alphabetical order or most recent.
* If you're signing up employees or workers for specific timeslots, you can now set that to half-hour increments
* Tweaked redirection code to handle confirmation and error messages on sites that don't have permalinks enabled
* Changed label for RSVPMaker widget as it shows up on the administrator's screen under Appearance.
* Added an uninstall script for removing custom tables and database entries.

* Cleaned up Event Dates, RSVP Options box in editor, moving less commonly used parameters to the bottom.
* Added a Tweak Permalinks setting (a hack for a few users who have reported "page not found" errors, possibly because some other plugin is overwriting the RSVPMaker rewrite rules).
* Tested with WP 3.1 release candidate
